# MK14displays
PCB designs for use with the MK14 SOC computer

There are 2 PCB designs to be used with the MK14 computer.

MK14display56 uses 2 x 4 digit 7-segment .56" Common cathode display modules.
The ones I used were labelled HS420561K-32 

MK14display3x3 uses 3 x 3 digit 7-segment .3" Common cathode display modules.
The ones I used were labelled TOT-3301AH-H 
This allows you to have a 9 digit display when the MK14 board is suitably modified.

In both cases there is a zip of the kicad files and a zip of the gerber files used to produce the boards.

Let me know if you find these useful and if you get them made up.
